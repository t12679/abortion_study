Key Information


This research is a survey of public opinion about people's opinion concerning controversial behaviors in US society. You will be asked a series of questions about this issue.  The survey should take around 6 minutes to complete. After completing the survey, you will be paid [$0.8 USD] for your participation.
We do not ask for your name or any other information that might identify you. De-identified information may be made public or used for future research purposes.
Your participation is voluntary. You may withdraw at any time and you may choose not to answer any question but you must proceed to the final screen of the study in order to receive your completion code which you must submit in order to be paid.
Please note that this survey will contain a mention of a man raping a woman, which may provoke emotional discomfort and may pose a potential risk to you. The survey will collect information and store it a password protected drive and a password protected cloud drive for six months for research purposes and will only be accessible to the Principal Investigator.
In accordance with Mechanical Turk/Connect policies, we may reject your work if the HIT was not correctly completed or the instructions were not followed. 

If you have any questions about this research study please contact me at j.thomas@cuhk.edu.hk. If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, contact the CUHK’s Secretary of the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (c/o Faculty Office of Social Science) at fssc02@cuhk.edu.hk

I file taxes as self-employed.  I consider myself much more spiritual than religious.  I pray many times a day and think about what would Maharaji want me to do when I have a quandary, but there is no way for me to actually attend any religious services unless I did so online as my Partner and I are both disabled and primarily homebound.  The closest that I can come to ""attending religious services"" is watching Kirtan chanting on YouTube.  I distrust leaders rather than a specific people.  For example, I have nothing against the Russian people but have a very, very low opinion of Putin for what he is doing to Ukraine.  One needs to get pregnant in order to have an abortion and I made very sure that I could not get pregnant by getting myself surgical sterilized as soon as I was old enough to do so.  I did this because I inherited Osteogenesis Imperfecta from my mother.  I understood while I was still a child that meant that if I someday had children, I could pass Osteogenesis Imperfecta on to them.  I was determined not to let that happen.  Since there was a genetic reason for me to get sterilized when I was in my early twenties, the doctors did not try to talk me out of it.  Thus abortion was never a consideration for me.  I would only advise abortion for someone already pregnant if either the birth defect was so bad that the baby was unlikely to make it to birth (or would probably die within hours of being born) or the life of the mother was at risk.  If the mother cannot afford the child, then there are almost always those who are looking to adopt a baby.",027F105EFD1C4D41941C0F2259B9F692,,,,,,,4f96e2bb-8287-40e0-aace-f716a0a71fc9,d97b1540-a79e-44ba-8e2b-7d1a12b60efa,0,0,,1

If a woman's health is in danger needs to be more specific. Is she in immediate danger? Is it physical or mental danger? How many woman have given birth knowing their life would be in danger and actually died? I think it comes down to each person's view of life. The woman was raped which is tragic. I could not imagine carrying a baby conceived under such a situation. But should the baby, which is an independent life, be punished and killed? I do not feel the pro-abortion voices are being supportive of life. I think they would through away a baby because being a mother and taking care of children is not part of the liberated woman's doctrine. I also think it is an attempt to show hatred toward God for having women bear children instead of men. I think there are a lot of hidden agendas and philosophies behind abortion. Also, it is historically true abortion was a tool of the white supremacist to rid the industrialized white world of inferior minorities.
